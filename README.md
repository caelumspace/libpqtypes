# libpqtypes

This is a fork of the official libpqtypes repository once maintained by Andrew Chernow and Merlin Moncure from eSilo [(see http://libpqtypes.esilo.com/)](http://libpqtypes.esilo.com/).
The reason for creating this fork is a slow reaction from libpqtypes developers to some newly found bugs.
